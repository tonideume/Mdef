# Machine Paradox

In this hands-on two-week seminar, we dive into understanding how machines work and how to give them new life. We start by gathering discarded machines and everyday devices, exploring ones that catch our interest. From there, we disassemble them piece by piece, studying each component. Through this, we realize that we often toss devices out of convenience or because we don't fully understand their electronics, when, with a little know-how, they could actually be fixed.
